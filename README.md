# Analysis-and-prediction-of-crimes-against-women
## About
This project combines data analysis and web technology to predict the safety level of a specific geographical location based on historical crime 

## Features
Data Analysis: Utilizes advanced data analysis techniques to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations in crime data related to women's safety.

Machine Learning Models: Implements machine learning algorithms such as K-means clustering, support vector machines (SVM), and TensorFlow-based models to predict crime occurrences and safety levels for women.

Real-time Notifications: Provides real-time notifications and alerts to authorities and users about crime incidents, potential threats, and emergency situations.

Emergency Alerts: Allows users to send emergency alerts with location details, enabling quick response and assistance from law enforcement agencies or support networks.

Interactive Visualization: Offers interactive data visualizations to understand crime trends, hotspot areas, and historical patterns, aiding in decision-making and resource allocation.

Predictive Analysis: Generates predictive insights on future crime trends and risk assessment, enabling proactive measures and preventive actions.

User Engagement: Engages users through a user-friendly interface with features like safety prediction submission, crime data access, and emergency alert functionalities.

Collaborative Platform: Facilitates collaboration among law enforcement agencies, policymakers, and community stakeholders by sharing data-driven insights and fostering informed discussions on women's safety issues.
## Requirements
Data Collection: Gather comprehensive and reliable data on crimes against women, including types of crimes, locations, demographics, and timeframes.

Data Preprocessing: Cleanse, preprocess, and transform the collected data to ensure accuracy, consistency, and compatibility with machine learning algorithms.

Machine Learning Models: Develop and implement machine learning models, such as K-means clustering, SVM, and TensorFlow-based neural networks, for crime prediction and safety level assessment.

Real-time Data Integration: Integrate real-time data feeds or APIs to ensure that the system has access to up-to-date crime data for analysis and prediction.

User Interface: Design and develop a user-friendly web interface that allows users to submit safety predictions, access crime visualizations, and send emergency alerts easily.

Alerting System: Implement a robust alerting system that sends real-time notifications and emergency alerts to users, authorities, and support networks based on predefined triggers and thresholds.

Visualization Tools: Incorporate interactive data visualization tools to present crime trends, hotspots, predictive insights, and other relevant information in a visually appealing and understandable format.
